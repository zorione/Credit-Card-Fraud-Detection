# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Problem 
A Fraud Detection System using transaction history of book store. The vast majority of users will not be Fraudulent, making it harder for us to detect 
the Underlying Patterns in the information available 

## Model Used
_Decision Tree Classifier_ and _Random Forest Classifier_ 
Also, we have used CNN (Deep Learning) to make the same model, and to compensate for the Highly Unbalanced Dataset, we have also used  Under-Sampling and Over-Sampling.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit Learn
- Keras
